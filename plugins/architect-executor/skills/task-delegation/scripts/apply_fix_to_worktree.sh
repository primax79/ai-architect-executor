# Apply a fixed file to a path inside a git worktree without needing
# direct file-edit access to that worktree (e.g. when Read/Edit/Write
# and shell cat/grep/sed are permission-blocked against it, but `git`
# subcommands are not). See ../references/worktree-git-plumbing.md for
# the full explanation of why/when this is needed.
#
# Usage:
#   apply_fix_to_worktree.sh <worktree-path> <path-relative-to-worktree> <fixed-file>
#
# <path-relative-to-worktree> may be an existing tracked path (it will
# be updated) or a brand-new path (it will be added).
#
# This only stages and materializes the file — it does NOT commit.
# Run your verification, then `git -C <worktree-path> commit` yourself.
